              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full stack developer (MERN) with a background in fire sprinkler designer. I am a proficient designer but did not love what I was doing and the COVID-19 pandemic spurred me into making a career change.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an Associates of Applied Science in Engineering CAD Technology from Hennepin Tech and recently completed the MERN Full Stack boot camp from UMN.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course, as a team of two, I developed a straightforward web app, Farmanger, utilizing HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, API routing, MySQL with Sequelize, and JavaScript in the DOM to help a backyard/CSA farmer track their crops and the fields where theyâ€™re grown.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fire sprinkler designer, I have managed and designed large projects (e.g. Life Time Fitness, Edina, MN) and worked collaboratively all my career with a high level of communication and organization.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am eager to learn and excited to create. I love to problem solve and have a great appreciation when design meets functionality.</p>
